题目：基于RTMPose的耳朵穴位关键点检测<br>
背景：根据中医的“倒置胎儿”学说，耳朵的穴位反映了人体全身脏器的健康，耳穴按摩可以缓解失眠多梦、内分泌失调等疾病。耳朵面积较小，但穴位密集，涉及耳舟、耳轮、三角窝、耳甲艇、对耳轮等三维轮廓，普通人难以精准定位耳朵穴位。<br>

Title: Ear Acupoint Key Point Detection Based on RTMPose<br>

Background: According to the theory of "Inverted Fetus" in traditional Chinese medicine, the acupoints on the ear reflect the health of the body's internal organs. Ear acupressure can alleviate conditions such as insomnia, hormonal imbalances, and other disorders. Despite the small size of the ear, it contains a dense network of acupoints that encompass the auricle, helix, triangular fossa, tragus, and antitragus, forming a complex three-dimensional contour. It is challenging for the average person to accurately locate these ear acupoints.<br>
